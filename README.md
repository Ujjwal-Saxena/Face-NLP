Hey Everyone!!
I have complete python code in jupyter notebook describing all basic needs of machine learning.Much of this includes opencv files
and some projects on NLP.
In opencv files I have written code starting from very basic to advanced utilities.Just copy the required part of the code and run it on jupy 
ter notebook.
You can also diretlcy download the complete zip file and perform the similar task.
